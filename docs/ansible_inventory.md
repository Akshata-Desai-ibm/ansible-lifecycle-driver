# Ansible Inventory

## Introduction

The "config/inventory" file contains inventory for VMs that are accessed using the [Ansible SSH connection plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/connection.html#ssh-plugins); the "inventory.k8s" file contains inventory for containers that are accessed using the [Ansible kubectl connection plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/connection/kubectl.html). If you wish to split your inventory out in to separate host variable files then you may do so. For example:

```
config
  host_vars
    host1.yml
  inventory
  inventory.k8s
```

## Variable Substitution

The Ansible Lifecycle Driver supports the substitution of LM properties in inventory files under the "config" directory, using [Jinja2 template variables](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/#variables). The following properties are available:

* properties: the set of LM request properties.
* system_properties: the set of system properties.
* dl_properties: deployment location properties.

For example, the following inventory file substitutes the LM property "properties.mgmt_ip_address" for "ansible_host":

```
---
ansible_user: ubuntu
ansible_host: {{ properties.mgmt_ip_address }}
ansible_ssh_pass: ubuntu
ansible_connection: ssh
ansible_become_pass: ubuntu
ansible_sudo_pass: ubuntu
```

Note that both square brackets and dot notation are supported during property substitution. For example, "properties['prop1']" and "properties.prop1" are equivalent.

## Support for SSH and K8s Connections

The Ansible Lifecycle Driver supports inventory for SSH and K8s connections, as described in the introduction.

## SSH Connections

An example SSH inventory file:

```
---
ansible_user: ubuntu
ansible_host: {{ properties.mgmt_ip_address }}
ansible_ssh_pass: ubuntu
ansible_connection: ssh
ansible_become_pass: ubuntu
ansible_sudo_pass: ubuntu
```

In this example, the ansible_host is set to an LM property value.

## K8s Connections

It is assumed that, for K8s inventory, the infrastructural part (that is, the pods and other K8s infrastructure) have been created using the [K8s VIM Driver](https://github.com/accanto-systems/k8s-vim-driver). In particular, the K8s VIM driver ensures that the following properties have been set which are required by the Ansible Lifecycle Driver K8s connection handling:

* properties.host: the pod name to connect to

An example K8s inventory file:

```
---
ansible_connection: kubectl
ansible_kubectl_pod: {{ properties.host }}
ansible_kubectl_namespace: {{ dl_properties['k8s-namespace'] }}
ansible_kubectl_kubeconfig: {{ dl_properties.kubeconfig_path }}
```

| Name            | Value | Required                           | Detail                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ansible_connection      | kubectl       | Y                                  | The Ansible connection type, must be "kubectl" for K8s connections |
| ansible_kubectl_pod | True    | Y                                  | The pod to connect to
| ansible_kubectl_namespace     | -       | Y | The K8s namespace in which the pod is running
| ansible_kubectl_kubeconfig    | dl_properties.kubeconfig_path | Y | A kubeconfig file generated by the Ansible Lifecycle Driver


## Using a Jumphost in Inventory

It is often necessary to use a [Jumphost](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-configure-a-jump-host-to-access-servers-that-i-have-no-direct-access-to) to access a VM using SSH. It is possible to do this with the Ansible Lifecycle Driver using an inventory like this:

```
---
ansible_user: ubuntu
ansible_host: {{ properties.mgmt_ip_address }}
ansible_ssh_pass: ubuntu
ansible_connection: ssh
ansible_become_pass: ubuntu
ansible_sudo_pass: ubuntu
ssh_with_jumphost: "-o 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ProxyCommand='sshpass -p {{ properties.jumphost_password }} ssh -o 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -W %h:%p {{ properties.jumphost_username }}@{{ properties.jumphost_ip }}'"
ssh_without_jumphost: "-o 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
ansible_ssh_common_args: "{{ ssh_with_jumphost if properties.jumphost_ip is defined else ssh_without_jumphost }}"
```

If the LM properties have defined a "jumphost_ip" property this configuration will construct "ansible_ssh_common_args" using ProxyCommand to proxy the SSH connection through the jumphost, using jumphost properties from the LM request. If not, a standard direct SSH connection is configured.
